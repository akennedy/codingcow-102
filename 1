Hello Coders, I am the coding cow!
Welcome to CodingCow 102

Setting up AngularJS 

In this lesson, we will setup angularJS 
in our browserify/beefy setup.  There 
are several ways to get angular setup, 
download, cdn, bower, napa, etc.  We 
will use bower, but a little different 
than everyone else, what do you expect, 
I am cow!
