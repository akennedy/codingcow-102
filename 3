Currently, our dev setup has an app.js 
file and browserify and beefy installed.  
To get started lets go ahead install bower.  
Bower is a global node module that lets 
us pull frontend javascript modules 
into our project.

Add bower to your install scripts node in package.json

"scripts": { "install": "npm install bower -g" }

Cow Says: npm install && ./n
