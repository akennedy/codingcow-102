MOOOOoooosome!  You have just setup angularjs with
your application.  And all you have to do to start
writting some code is:

npm install
npm start

// need to add more bower components

bower install [module]

// also writting html setup code to init your index.html
// may not be the best idea, so if you want to address
// it just create an index.html in your project root
// and beefy will use it instead of generating the html.

Cow Says: ./r
